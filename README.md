# BellasEye
A lightweight program written in BASH which automates and saves time during vulnerability analysis and penetration testing. It automates various tools such as NMAP, Gobuster, theHarvester etc. It uses a custom designed Vulnerability Lookup which parses major databases like ExploitDB, National Vulnerability Database and VulDB (requires an API key). It saves all the outputs to separate files for easy use.

## Setting up
First we need to make requirements.sh executable before running. It will make sure you have all the tools/files available. 
**Make sure you run this as root.**
```
chmod +x requirements.sh
./requirements.sh
```

## Tutorial
1. Run the main script as
`./BellasEye`
<img src="/images/image2.PNG" alt="main" />

2. You may select a single option or you can automate multiple tasks by selecting multiple options, separated by a comma. All the duplicate processes will be skipped.

## Vulnerability Lookup
You can search for any vulnerability by passsing a query in the form of a product name with/without version, CVE id, CPE id or even CWE id. The program will parse three major databases: 
  1. ExploitDb
  2. National Vulnerability Database
  3. VulDB (Requires API key)

<img src="/images/vul2.PNG" alt="vul2" />

## API Key Setup For VulDB
1. Got to vuldb.com and create an account. 
2. Go to profile and copy your api key
